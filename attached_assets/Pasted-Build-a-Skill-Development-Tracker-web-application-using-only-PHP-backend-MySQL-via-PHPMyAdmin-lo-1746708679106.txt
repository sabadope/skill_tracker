Build a Skill Development Tracker web application using only PHP (backend), MySQL via PHPMyAdmin (localhost), HTML, Tailwind CSS (for styling), and JavaScript (for interactivity).

ðŸ“Œ Purpose: To monitor and measure intern skill development (both technical and soft skills) during the internship. It includes dashboards for interns, evaluation panels for supervisors, and reports for HR/admins.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

1. Intern Skill Dashboard
Intern login system (PHP sessions)

View and update initial and current skill levels

List of skills with selectable levels (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)

Progress bars and badges using Tailwind for gamification

Learning suggestions for weak skill areas

Simple and responsive design with Tailwind CSS

2. Supervisor Evaluation Panel
Supervisor login

View intern profiles and skill progress

Rate each skill, leave comments, and suggest training

Side-by-side comparison of intern self-assessment vs supervisor rating

Assign mentoring sessions or tasks

3. Analytics & Reporting (HR/Admin View)
Generate visual skill growth reports using basic JS charts (e.g., Chart.js)

Filter by department, skill, intern, or time range

Export reports to PDF or printable format

Identify top-performing interns and skill gaps

4. Security & Access Control
Role-based login: intern, supervisor, admin

Interns can only edit their own skill data

Supervisors can view and validate intern progress

Admins can view all reports and analytics

Use PHP session control and basic data validation

5. Database Design (MySQL via PHPMyAdmin - localhost)
Suggested Table: skill_development

  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  intern_id INT NOT NULL,
  skill_name VARCHAR(100),
  initial_level VARCHAR(50),
  current_level VARCHAR(50),
  supervisor_rating VARCHAR(10),
  last_updated DATE
);
